<h1 class="text-info">Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3 class="text-info">Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>

<p>It is TeenCode’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
     our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://tcspace.azurewebsites.net">tcspace.azurewebsites.net</a>
     (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "tcspace.azurewebsites.net"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
     protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have 
    adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
     Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information
     to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and 
    does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
     general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
     visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

<h2 class="text-info">Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, TeenCode collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
     that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
     referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TeenCode’s purpose in collecting
     non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TeenCode’s visitors use its 
    website. From time to time, TeenCode may release non-personally-identifying information in the 
    aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>TeenCode also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Email Address for users
    that fill out the contact us form. TeenCode only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses 
    under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
     described below.</p>

<h2 class="text-info">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to TeenCode’s websites choose to interact with TeenCode in ways that require TeenCode
     to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TeenCode
     gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, when we ask visitors to give us their 
    email address for follow up on contacting us.

<h2 class="text-info">Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
     transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
     strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot 
    guarantee its absolute security.</p>



<h2 class="text-info">Links To External Sites</h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a 
    third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
     review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices
     of any third party sites, products or services.</p>



<h2 class="text-info">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, TeenCode may change its Privacy Policy from time
     to time, and in TeenCode’s sole discretion. TeenCode encourages visitors to frequently check this
     page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
     this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
